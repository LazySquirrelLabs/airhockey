## Development
The game is a simple toy project with two purposes: practice 2D game development and kick-start the development of complete games as side projects. I chose a simple game genre intentionally, to ease the development and increase the changes of it making into a complete game. 

The game was developed using the Unity game engine. All code and art assets (except for the audio) were created in-house. You can access the project [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/4qmWZ7Zt/air-hockey) for its road map and development history.
